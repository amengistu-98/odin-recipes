    <ol>
        <li>Cut potatoes in halves or quarters so they are all even-sized.</li>
        <li>Bring a pot of water or broth to a boil and parboil the potatoes until 
            they can easily be pierced with a fork (about 10-12 minutes).</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (or 230 degrees Celsius) while potatoes are boiling.</li>
        <li>Once potatoes are parboiled, put them in a large boil and add cornstarch, duck fat, salt, and your seasonings
            and toss them until the potatoes are combined. 
        </li>
        <li>Spread potatoes in a baking tray or sheet that is lined with parchment paper, making sure that they don't 
            touch each other.</li>
        <li>Roast the potatoes in oven for 40 to 50 minutes until crispy, making sure to toss them half way through cooking to 
            promote even browning on all sides of the chopped potatoes.</li>
    </ol>
